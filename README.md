# 🗓️ Client Booker API

**Client Booker** is a .NET training project focused on creating a simple and well-structured **RESTful API** to manage client appointments.

This repository is ideal for those practicing ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, and API best practices using modern tools and patterns.

> ✅ This project does **not use AutoMapper** — all mapping between entities and DTOs is done manually to reinforce core development skills and ensure greater control over the data flow.

> ✅ It also includes training on **unit testing** using **nUnit** and **Moq**, for test controllers and services effectively.
